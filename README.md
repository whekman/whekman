### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a quantum physics background with previous experience as a data scientist and scientific model developer. A course on computational physics (modelling gas and Ising lattices) got me hooked on Python which then led me to doing a theoretical Msc research in foundations of quantum mechanics. Coming from a scientific background I am interested in data, systems modelling and finding optimal solutions. After some years teaching physics I am looking forward to re-enter the tech industry and work with the latest data technologies such as AWS, Airflow, Snowflake and contribute to valuable insights and reliable, efficient architecture implementations and automation.
