### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a quantum physics background with previous experience as a data scientist and scientific model developer.

A course on computational physics (modelling gas and Ising lattices) got me hooked on Python which then led me to doing a theoretical Msc research in foundations of quantum mechanics.

Coming from a scientific background I am interested in data, systems modelling and finding optimal solutions.
